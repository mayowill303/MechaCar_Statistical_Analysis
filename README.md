# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of thesuspension coils from the manufacturing lots Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statisticallydifferent from the mean population Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of theMechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
